[19:04:03] Zoomsplat(E) : Ah okay. Thanks :). Didn't see them in their normal spot
[19:53:50] Grimack(E) : Does loot drops get lower when you raise higher level?
[19:54:04] Ô5Geriond(E) : no
[19:54:14] Gensoku(E) : level has no bearing on treasure
[19:54:29] Grimack(E) : so a 99 could farm fire crystals on a low level mobs?
[19:54:50] Otsureku(E) : crystals require you to get exp - and the mob to be in a conquest zone
[19:54:57] Ô3Galkapryme(E) : best place to farm crystals is the AH
[19:55:01] Ô4Diosax(E) : go to sky to farm em 
[19:55:27] Gensoku(E) : that's a mechanic tied to Signet, so it does require your target to grant you exp in some form. 
[19:55:28] Ô4Sabishii(E) : when you're high enough, sky, yeah, you can get clusters from the elemental mobs in sky
[19:55:39] Ô4Diosax(E) : you can go Ru'Aun Gardens and farm fire elementals and else 
[19:56:07] Ô4Hiddenfist(E) : can also farm crystals in SoA areas like Foret de Hennetiel, Morimar Basalt Fields etc... they fall like rain
[19:56:16] Grimack(E) : Thanks, i was woried i wouldnt be able to raise crafts if i couldnt loot the items needed
[19:56:18] Ô3Galkapryme(E) : You can also get Crystals in Reisenjima, but I don't know if you can specifically get Fires.
[19:56:45] Ô4Hiddenfist(E) : Morimar Basalt Fields to get fire crystals
[19:56:53] Ô3Galkapryme(E) : yup
[19:57:13] Ô4Diosax(E) : trays true but better farm clusters x,x e/a cluster = 12 
[20:02:43] Grimack(E) : So... Drops will always drop, but Crystals need a form of "exp"
[20:02:59] Ô4Hiddenfist(E) : yes
[20:03:18] Ô3Orthus(E) : yes, beastmen seals also work that way
[20:03:35] Ô4Helodur(E) : correct, they need the zone signet-like spell and receiving Experience points
[20:04:09] Ô4Helodur(E) : crystals, that is.
[21:45:28] Grimack(E) : i can no longer use this in 10mins so i wanted to thank everyone for their help. (time too short)
